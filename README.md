# COMP472: Mini Chess
Project for the COMP 472 course at Concordia University Canada for the Winter 2025 semester

## Description
This project implements a simplified version of chess called Mini Chess, played on a 5x5 board. The game features two playres (White and Black) with pieces including a King, Queen, Bishop, Knight and Pawns. The goal is to capture the opponent's King. The project focuses on implementing adversarial search algorithms (Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning) and heuristic evaluation functions to create an AI that can play Mini Chess autonomously.
